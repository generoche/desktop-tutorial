## More Things To Add

One of the key skills for long-term sucess in an academic career, either as an administrator or a faculty member is building a more sophisticated understanding of your own cognitive processes.   Most of us think of ourselves as being naturally analytical and logical, but a reading even a couple of books should make us less confident of that natural ability.  Thinking deeply about our learning is hard work and requires learning new sets of skills and habits that we will be covering in more depth in this program.

One useful framework can help us understand the fact that decisions we make are heavily impacted by psychological biases that we are not always aware of. In his best-selling book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, renowned psychologist Daniel Kahneman explores the two different thinking systems that drive the way we process information and make choices.   

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional. It is the thinking system we use when we make snap judgments or when we need to come up with an answer quickly. System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. It is the thinking system we use when we need to focus, pay attention, and solve problems. 

Humans have evolved to count on System 1 thinking for most daily decisions as a way of conserving

## What is Daniel Kahneman's theory?

Daniel Kahneman's theory is that two thinking systems drive the way we process information and make decisions. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional. It is the thinking system we use when we make snap judgments or when we need to come up with an answer quickly. System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. It is the thinking system we use when we need to focus, pay attention, and solve problems. 
How does this theory impact our decision-making?

The purpose of a graduate degree is to

Kahneman's theory has implications for the way we make decisions in our personal and professional lives. For example, when we are deciding something we are not familiar with, we are more likely to rely on System 1 thinking. This can lead to us making snap judgments that are not always accurate. On the other hand, when we are deciding something that is important and requires thoughtful consideration, we are more likely to use System 2 thinking. This can help us to avoid making impulsive decisions that we may regret later. 

What are the implications of this theory?

The implications of this theory are far-reaching. For educators and administrators, Kahneman's theory provides a framework for understanding how students and adults make decisions. It can also help us to avoid making decisions that are based on impulses or stereotypes. 

To wrap things up

In conclusion, Kahneman's theory of fast and slow thinking is a useful framework for understanding how we make decisions. This theory can help us to avoid making impulsive decisions and to focus on the factors that are most important when we are making choices.
